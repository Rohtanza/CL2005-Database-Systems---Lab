In recent versions of Debian (like i am using debain 12), the MySQL service is replaced by MariaDB. Therefore, you should use mariadb instead of mysql when starting, stopping, or checking the status of the service.

Here are the updated commands:

1. If you haven't installed MariaDB yet, you can install it using the following command:

        sudo apt install mariadb-server

2. To start the MariaDB service:

        sudo systemctl start mariadb

3. To check the status of the MariaDB service:

        sudo systemctl status mariadb

after doing this i am checking if my mysql server is running:

    sudo systemctl status mysql

and its telling me that its running but i am still getting error

command i am running "mysql -u root -"p

Enter password:
ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'

Lets now resolve this
so its better to use
        sudo mysql -u root

and then use enter

            USE mysql

and use mariadb as mysql and do your work
